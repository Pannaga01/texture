I always want to work. I do not want to let my time go away in an unproductive way. So, I believe i will learn and do the tasks with utmost sincerity. I would like to work on creating websites, working on databases.I have a basic idea on bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery. I would want to do anything that comes my way as I am still in the process of exploring.
