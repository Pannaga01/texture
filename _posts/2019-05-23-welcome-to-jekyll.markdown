I always want to grab the opportunities provided to me and do the best in it. I always want to do something additional and get more. AMRITA-CS-STAR looked like a very good opportunity to learn more and do more. I am interested in web developmemnt and these tasks also looked interesting while i was doing them. I would like to learn more under a good guidance, hence would want to be part of this.
